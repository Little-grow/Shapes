# Shapes
**Shape Calculator Application**

**Objective:**
Develop an ASP.NET MVC application that allows users to calculate the area or volume of 2D and 3D shapes, respectively. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for selecting the type of calculation (area or volume) and then inputting the required formula variables based on the chosen shape.

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Interface:**
   - The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface.
   - There should be a clear option to choose between calculating the area or volume.
   - Depending on the selection, the UI should dynamically update to display relevant input fields and formulas.

2. **Calculation Options:**
   - Users should be able to select either area or volume calculation mode.
   - In area calculation mode:
     - Users should be able to choose from a list of 2D shapes (e.g., circle, triangle, rectangle).
     - For the selected shape, the application should display the formula and prompt the user to input the required variables.
   - In volume calculation mode:
     - Users should be able to choose from a list of 3D shapes (e.g., sphere, cube, cylinder).
     - For the selected shape, the application should display the formula and prompt the user to input the required variables.

3. **Input Validation:**
   - The application should validate user inputs to ensure they meet the required format and constraints.
   - Provide clear error messages in case of invalid inputs.

4. **Calculation Accuracy:**
   - Implement precise mathematical formulas for calculating the area and volume of each shape.
   - Ensure that the application provides accurate results based on user inputs.

5. **Results Display:**
   - After performing the calculation, display the result in a user-friendly format.
   - Include units (e.g., square units for area, cubic units for volume) with the result.

6. **Reset and Clear:**
   - Offer an option to reset the input fields and calculation results.
   - Provide a button or option to clear all fields and start a new calculation.

7. **Responsive Design:**
   - Make the application responsive to various screen sizes and devices to enhance usability.

8. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the application works as intended.
   - Verify the correctness of calculations for various shapes and input scenarios.

**Technical Requirements:**

1. **Technology Stack:**
   - Utilize ASP.NET MVC for the web application.
   - Implement client-side and server-side validation for user inputs.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the application, including user guides and technical documentation.
